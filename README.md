# Serious Thinking

This is a project to write down a model of how to think about things seriously, or what I will hereafter refer to as **serious thinking**. The purpose of this is to help people think more seriously, and better recognize serious (or perhaps more importantly, unserious) thinking in others. The heart of this project is the serious thinking wiki, where I will attempt to write my ideas and catalogue them in a way that makes clear the conntections between them.
